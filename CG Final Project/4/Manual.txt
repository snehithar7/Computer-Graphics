FILES:


1. The file " 3DCube.html" consists of a 3D  transformation of  the object Cube.

2. The file " Dimetric.html" consists of Parallel  Dimetric projection of  the object  Cube.

3. The file " Isometric.html" consists of a Parallel Isometric projection of  the object Cube.

4.The file " Trimetric.html" consists of a  Parallel Trimetric projection of  the object Cube.

5.The file " Pyramid.html" consists of a 3D  transformation of  the object Pyramid.

6.The file " cylinder.html" consists of a 3D  transformation of  the object cylinder.

7.I included additional files of css-Style1.css and background Image-Blue.jpg.

8.three.js and three1.js libraries  are added for the 3D transformations of the Geometric objects.

Overall working on different 3D viewings of the geometric figures is very interesting and i learned the Camera positions and rendering of the objects.
Hopefully i will add different features in the coming weeks.
