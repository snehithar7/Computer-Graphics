I have used CSS,HTML canvas, javascript, script tags  to develop the programs.

Each html file are under the link provided.

All the html pages works and runs fine on Google Chrome Browser.


FILES:


1. The file, Fractal.html, is an html file, which consists the html and javascript code to draw fractal based on given input primitive in the canvas.
Select the primitive and then select the denominator of the ratio and iterations.Please note that the numerator is fixed value 1.
Web page has two buttons Draw and ClearCanvas to draw primitive and clear canvas respectively.

Another option for the border color is selected where we can select the border color of the drawn primitive.





2.The file,  Wheel.html, is an html file,  which consists the html and javascript code to draw the shape of the wheel in the canvas.
There are  two text areas on webpage , for the radius of the wheel and score of the driver.
There are two buttons, on web page  one for drawing on canvas and one for clearing the canvas.
The draw button when clicked  the function DrawWheel is called takes score and radius as input and based on that the wheel is drawed.
The code also has two drop down menu's, one for the  border color of the wheel and one for filling color inside the wheel.
